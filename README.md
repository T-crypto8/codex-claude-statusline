[![CI](https://github.com/T-crypto8/codex-claude-statusline/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/T-crypto8/codex-claude-statusline/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A multi-line status line for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) that turns the bottom of your terminal into a cockpit:

| Line | What it shows | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | cwd + git branch | statusLine payload + `git` |
| 2 | model, context %, 5h / 7d rate limits with reset times | statusLine payload |
| 3 | **Codex CLI** remaining quota + rough session cost | `~/.codex/sessions` rollout files |
| 4 | Claude session cost + **daily total across all sessions** | statusLine payload + local transcripts |
| 5 | other live Claude Code sessions and what they're doing | `~/.claude/sessions` registry |

Costs are estimates at API list prices — on a subscription plan they are a relative gauge, not a bill. Unknown models are priced at the most expensive tier on purpose (estimates err high, never silently low).

## Who is this for

Maintainers and power users who run **Codex CLI and Claude Code side by side** on AI-assisted development: cost visibility, context usage, remaining quota, and parallel agent sessions directly affect how you plan review, triage, and release work. This cockpit keeps all of it in one glance, locally, with zero dependencies.

## AI agent quickstart

Working with Claude Code or Codex CLI? Paste this block and the agent does the rest:

```text
Install codex-claude-statusline for me:
1. git clone https://github.com/T-crypto8/codex-claude-statusline.git ~/.claude-statusline
2. Merge {"statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude-statusline/statusline.py"}}
   into ~/.claude/settings.json, preserving all existing keys.
3. mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-statusline and copy config.example.json there as config.json
4. Ask me which strings to put in mask_patterns (my name, company, client names),
   then set them in the config.
5. Verify: `echo '{}' | python3 ~/.claude-statusline/statusline.py` must print 5 lines
   without errors. If I use Codex only, set lines.cost to false and show me the
   standalone `watch` command instead of editing settings.json.
```

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+. No third-party packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T-crypto8/codex-claude-statusline.git ~/.claude-statusline
```

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "python3 ~/.claude-statusline/statusline.py"
  }
}
```

## Configure

Copy the example and edit — every emoji, label, and line is yours to change:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-statusline
cp ~/.claude-statusline/config.example.json ~/.config/claude-statusline/config.json
```

- **Change the mascot**: set `icons.prefix` to anything (`"🐱"`, `"🦊"`, `"❯"`, your initials…). Every other icon is configurable too.
- **Hide lines you don't need**: `lines.codex / cost / parallel` → `false`. No Codex CLI installed? Line 3 just shows `—` (or turn it off).
- **Currency**: `currency.code` `"USD"` shows raw dollars. Set e.g. `{"code": "JPY", "symbol": "¥", "fallback_rate": 155}` to convert via the free [frankfurter.app](https://frankfurter.app) API (cached 12h, falls back gracefully offline).
- **Screenshot safety**: put any strings you never want rendered (your name, company, client names) in `mask_patterns` — they are replaced with `mask_replacement` in the final output, whatever line they appear on. Useful because line 5 echoes prompts from your other sessions.
- Config path override: `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`.
- Pricing override: drop a `pricing.json` next to the scripts (same shape as `DEFAULT_PRICING` in `usage_estimate.py`) or set `CLAUDE_STATUSLINE_PRICING`.

## Using with Codex CLI (no Claude Code needed)

Line 3 already tracks Codex CLI quota and session cost from `~/.codex/sessions`. If you live in Codex (or anything else), run the cockpit standalone — it detects the missing payload and renders what it can:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude-statusline/statusline.py        # one-shot
watch -n 30 python3 ~/.claude-statusline/statusline.py   # live, e.g. in a tmux pane
```

Tip for Codex-only users: set `lines.cost` to `false` (Claude transcript scan) and keep `codex` + `parallel`.

## Standalone usage report

The daily-cost engine also works as a CLI:

```bash
python3 usage_estimate.py --today          # today's sessions
python3 usage_estimate.py --days 7         # last week, by date/project/model
python3 usage_estimate.py --days 30 --json # machine-readable
```

## Notes

- Heavy work is cached under the system temp dir (`claude-statusline/`): daily cost 60s, Codex scan 120s, FX 12h. The status line itself stays fast.
- Everything fails soft: no network, no Codex, no session registry → `—`, never a crash.
- Line 5 liveness uses `kill -0` on registered pids; sessions older than 24h are ignored even if the pid was recycled.
